The following files all relate, in some fashion, to the task of converting "straight" netCDF (e.g., from a global emissions inventory (EI)) into I/O-API-formatted netCDF (aka, IOAPI):

Makefile.NCF2IOAPI_edgar
NCF2IOAPI.opoutfile_Edgar.f
NCF2IOAPI_Edgar4.F

gennet.f
from ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/contrib/gennet.f
see http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/contrib.html
(built by my Makefile.gennet)

read_IC_BC.f
generated by gennet.f from input netCDF=2008N2O_restart.nc

netcdf2ioapi.F
netcdf2ioapi.job
netcdf2ioapi.opoutfile.f
Makefile.netcdf2ioapi
adapted by me from similarly-named forebears above, mostly by copy/mod:
I should parameterize and reuse, but my makefile chops are long atrophied, and my Fortran chops are just now developing (through this project).
Motive: netcdf2ioapi ~= NCF2IOAPI_edgar - hardcode for the original application.
Should eventually become a template for creating EI-specific netCDF->IOAPI converters, e.g.:

netcdf2ioapi_IC_BC.F ~= read_IC_BC.f + netcdf2ioapi.F, intending to IOAPI-ize 2008N2O_restart.nc
Makefile.netcdf2ioapi_IC_BC is copy/mod of Makefile.netcdf2ioapi: see reuse apology above.
